# Churn-project
Our objective during this project is to put machine learning at the service of 
the detection of customers who will leave the telephone operator (Churn customers).
The Final Project file contains the classification (Supervised learning) while the Churn-project file contains a segmentation (Unsupervised learning) and the two methods 
will lead us to predict if a customer will churn.
I recommend this project to people who are new into this field and they want to improve their skills since this project can help you dive right in the basics of data science and 
machine learning.
By the end of this project you will be able to understand your data and make useful decisions also you will be able to deal with NAN and noisy data by using functions as isna() and drop to deal with NAN, do a quantative comparison between the mean and the median to detect the outliers, countplot() to understand you data and many other functions well 
detailed in the code.
